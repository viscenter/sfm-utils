# PySfMUtils
A Python package for interacting with Structure-from-Motion (SfM) projects. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* numpy 1.15+

## Installation
```shell script
pip install PySfm
```

## Usage
This package was originally designed to ease the process of importing pose priors into 
[OpenMVG](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG). It contains a format agnostic interface for defining an SfM Scene and its
component parts:

```python
import sfm_utils as sfm

# Create the scene
scene = sfm.Scene()
scene.root_dir = '/path/to/images/'

# Construct a view
view = sfm.View()
view.path = "view.jpg"
view.width = 800
view.height = 600
view.camera_make = 'PySfMUtils'
view.camera_model = 'Test Camera'
scene.add_view(view)

# Add the view's intrinsics
intrinsic = sfm.IntrinsicRadialK3()
intrinsic.width = view.width
intrinsic.height = view.height
intrinsic.focal_length = 50
intrinsic.sensor_width = 36
view.intrinsic = scene.add_intrinsic(intrinsic)

# Add the view's pose
pose = sfm.Pose()
view.pose = scene.add_pose(pose)

# Write an OpenMVG project file
sfm.export_scene(path='sfm_data.json', scene=scene)
```

The exported `sfm_data.json` file can be passed directly to OpenMVG programs:

```shell
openMVG_main_ComputeFeatures -i sfm_data.json -o matches/
```

### Export to AliceVision/Meshroom
To export a scene to an AliceVision/Meshroom compatible json file, use `sfm_utils.export_scene`:

```python
import sfm_utils as sfm
scene = sfm.Scene()
...
sfm.export_scene(path='SfMData.json', scene=scene, fmt=sfm.Format.ALICE_VISION)
```

## Limitations
This package is a work-in-progress and currently implements only the most basic features needed to import pre-calibrated
camera pose information into OpenMVG. We will gladly accept pull requests for new features. Known limitations in the 
current implementation are as follows:

* Only Views, Poses, and Intrinsics are supported. Feature points, control points, tracks, etc. are not provided.
* Only the Pinhole, RadialK3, and BrownT2 camera intrinsics are implemented.
* The AliceVision json file matches an example file generated by Meshroom, but has not been tested 

## A Note on Camera Rotations
This package assumes a right-handed coordinate system, in contrast to the left-handed system used by OpenMVG. When 
exporting to OpenMVG, this package will automatically compose the `Pose.rotation` matrix with the following matrix:

```
-1,  0,  0
 0,  1,  0
 0,  0, -1
```
